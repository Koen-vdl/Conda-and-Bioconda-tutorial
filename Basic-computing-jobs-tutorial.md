# Basic-computing-jobs-tutorial

This tutorial will get you up and running with BEAST2 (Bayesian evolutionary analysis by sampling trees), a free software package for Bayesian evolutionary analysis of molecular sequences (https://www.beast2.org/). In this tutorial, you will get acquaninted with the basic workflow starting from a scratch (installation and setup your environment with conda) and visualization your results at the end of the tutorial. However, you can also install this software as a graphical user interface tool on your computer as BEAST2 is Java program. After BEAST2 installation successfully, you will have BEAST2 and BEAUTi2 (used for generating BEAST2 XML configuration files). At the end, you may need another program to visualize your time-tree, for example, FigTree but we will not go into details to interpret your tree because our objective for this tutorial is to help you get familiar yourself with bioinformatics tools. Perhaps you may have more questions after. Let's start setting up BEAST2! 

**1. Setting up BEAST2 environment**
```
conda create -n beast2_env beast2
```
This command line will generate a working environment as following the name 'beast2_env' and install Beast2 to your beast2_env environment.
